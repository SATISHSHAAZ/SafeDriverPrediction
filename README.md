This project is for an insurance company providing coverage for automobile accidents. As expected, the number of drivers submitting claims
is very less, making this prediction a highly imbalanced problem. As with any other imbalanced problem, accuracy is not the righ metric for 
this problem. We will depend on ROC curves and AUC for finding the right model.
